1. imperative programming : OOPs, procedure oriented, java  & python(OOPs+procedure+functional), 
                            C++(OOPs + procedure)

2. declarative programming : functional programming

Using both programming paradigms we can achieve solution to the problem.
The only difference is one paradigm will take more time but effecient and vice versa.
Based on the requirement we can choose the paradigm.

Ex: sugar can be produced by organic and non-organic methods.
    If we follow organic method: more cost, healthy
    If we follow non-organic method : less cost, not healthy

In similar manner programming paradigm depends.
