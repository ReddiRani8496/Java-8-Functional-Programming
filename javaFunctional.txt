Functional Interface:
====================
An interface contains only one method is called functional interface.
We can have multiple default methods inside the functional interface.

anonymous blocks:
================
a block without any name is called anonymous blocks.
we can declare anonymous blocks at class level and method level.
If we declare a anonymous blocks at class level, then it is executed everytime we create object.
anonymous block will be the starting statement of every constructor.

Method Reference:
================
Method reference is used to refer static methods, even constructors we can refer using new operator.

constructor reference:
----------------------
Student s = className::new; // calling constructor

Anonymous object:
================

If we want to use object reference only once, then go for anonymous object.

new clasName();


outer class access modifiers:
============================
public, default

inner class access modifiers:
============================
public, private, default, protected
